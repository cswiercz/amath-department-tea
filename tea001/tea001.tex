\title{AMath Tea Time --- Puzzle #1}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

{\it Hello, everyone! I thought it would be nice to have a weekly mathematical
  and programming puzzles to accompany our tea time activities. I don't want to
  puzzle to discourage people from talking with each other; quite the opposite!
  The weekly puzzle is meant to be discussed!

  I'll post new puzzles every Tuesday and add hints on Thursday.

\subsection*{Problem}

There are 2015 airports in the far away land of Dijkstrania. Every pair of
airports is connected by a nonstop flight in one or both directions. Show that
there is some airport from which it is possible to reach evey other airport in
at most two flights.
