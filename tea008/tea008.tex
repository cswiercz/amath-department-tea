\subsection*{Problem}

A casino machine accepts tokens of 32 different colors, one at a time. For each
color, the player can choose between two fixed rewards. Each reward is up to
\$10 cash, plus maybe another token. For example, a blue token always gives the
player a choice of getting either \$5 plus a red token or \$3 plus a yellow
token; a black token can always be exchanged either for \$10 (but no token) or
for a brown token (but no cash). A player may keep playing as long as they have
a token. Rob and Bob each have one white token. Rob watches Bob play and win
\$500. Prove that Rob can win at least \$1000.
