\subsection*{Problem}

Alice and Bob are playing a game on an infinite strip of graph paper. On
Alice's turn, she marks two empty squares of her choice with crosses. Bob, on
his turn, can erase and single {\it block} of crosses occupying {\it
  consecutive} squares. Can Alice create a line of 2015 crosses in a row?
