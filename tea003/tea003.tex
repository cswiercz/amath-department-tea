\subsection*{Problem}

\noindent {\it (This week's puzzle comes from Ben Lansdell!)} \\

\noindent The vicar said to the bellringer, {\it ``There are three members of
  my congregation, the product of whose ages is 2450. The sum of their ages is
  twice yours. Can you tell me their ages?''} \\

\noindent The bell-ringer thinks and says, {\it ``I haven't sufficient
  information.''} \\

\noindent The vicar replies, {\it ``It will suffice to say that I am older than
  any of you.''} \\

\noindent The bell-ringer then stated the three ages. What were they, along
with with that of the vicar? \\
