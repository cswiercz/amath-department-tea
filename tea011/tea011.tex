\subsection*{Problem}

\noindent {\bf Problem \#1:} I have seven of each of the seven types of
tetrominoes below. Can I arrange them to make a $28 \times 7$ rectangle? \\

\noindent {\bf Problem \#2:} Using only the first tetromino in the second row,
what is the maximum number of this tetromino that you can place on an $8 \times
8$ board without overlapping? (This piece is called the {\it S}, {\it inverse
  skew}, or {\it right snake} tetromino.) What about using only the second
tetromino in the second row? (This piece is called the {\it T} or {\it tetris}
tetromino.)
