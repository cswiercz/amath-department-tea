\subsection*{Problem}

\noindent Homer goes on the 100-Donut Diet. A 100-Donut Diet Plan specifies how
many of 100 total donuts Homer will eat each day. The diet requires that the
number of donuts he eats does not increase from one day to the next. For
example, one 5-day Donut Diet Plan is 40, 25, 25, 8, 2. \\

\noindent Are there more 100-Donut Diet Plans with an odd number of days or
plans where Homer eats an odd number of donuts on the first day?
