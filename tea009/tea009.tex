\subsection*{Problem}

{\it (Thank you to Ben Segal for submitting this week's puzzle!)} \\

\noindent Last night I sat behind two wizards, Azemelius and Bartholomew, on a
bus. I heard this conversation: \\

\noindent Azemelius: {\it I have a positive integer number of children, whose
  ages are positive integers. The product of their ages is my own age, and the
  sum of their ages is the number on this bus.} \\

\noindent Bartholomew (looking at the number of the bus): {\it Perhaps if you
  told me your age and how many children you had, I could work out their ages?}
\\

\noindent Azemelius: {\it No, you could not.} \\

\noindent Bartholomew: {\it Aha! At last I know how old you are!  (Bartholomew
  had been trying to find Azemeliusâ€™s age for a long time.)} \\

\noindent What is the number of the bus? \\
