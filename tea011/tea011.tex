\subsection*{Problem}

\noindent {\bf Problem \#1:} I have seven of each of the seven types of
tetrominoes below. Can I rearrange them to make a $28 \times 7$ rectangle?
(Note that a standard tetris playfield is $20 \times 10$.) \\

\noindent {\bf Problem \#2:} Using only the first tetromino in the second row,
what is the maximum number of this tetromino that you can place on an $8 \times
8$ board without overlapping? (This piece is called the {\it S}
a.k.a. $\!\!\!\!$ {\it inverse skew} a.k.a. $\!\!\!\!$ {\it right snake}
tetromino.)
